        Domain SID Remote Privilege Escalation (311401)","description":"Trust relationships
        are created between Windows NT or Windows 2000 domains to allow users in one
        domain to access resources in other domains without requiring them to authenticate
        separately to each domain.  When a user in a trusted domain requests access
        to a resource in a trusting domain, the trusted domain supplies authorization
        data in the form of a list of Security Identifiers (SIDs) that indicate the
        user''s identity and group memberships.  The trusting domain uses this data
        to determine whether to grant the user''s request.\n\nA vulnerability exists
        because the trusting domain does not verify that the trusted domain is actually
        authoritative for all the SIDs in the authorization data.  If one of the SIDs
        in the list identified a user or security group that is not in the trusted
        domain, the trusting domain would accept the information and use it for subsequent
        access control decisions.  If an attacker inserted chosen SIDs into the authorization
        data at the trusted domain, he could elevate his privileges to those associated
        with any desired user or group, including the Domain Administrators group
        for the trusting domain.  This would enable the attacker to gain full Domain

        2008 August 2017 Multiple Security Updates","description":"The remote Windows
        host is missing multiple security updates released on 2017\/08\/08. It is,
        therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :\n\n- A denial of service
        vulnerability exists when Microsoft Windows     improperly handles NetBIOS
        packets. An attacker who successfully     exploited this vulnerability could
        cause a target computer to     become completely unresponsive. A remote unauthenticated
        attacker     could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of TCP     packets
        to a target system, resulting in a permanent denial of     service condition.
        The update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting how the Windows network
        stack handles NetBIOS traffic.\n    (CVE-2017-0174)\n\n  - A buffer overflow
        vulnerability exists in the Microsoft JET     Database Engine that could allow
        remote code execution on an     affected system. An attacker who successfully
        exploited this     vulnerability could take complete control of an affected
        system.\n    An attacker could then install programs; view, change, or delete     data;
        or create new accounts with full user rights. Users whose     accounts are
        configured to have fewer user rights on the system     could be less impacted
        than users who operate with administrative     user rights. Exploitation of
        this vulnerability requires that a     user open or preview a specially crafted
        database file while using     an affected version of Microsoft Windows. In
        an email attack     scenario, an attacker could exploit the vulnerability
        by sending a     specially crafted database file to the user and then convincing     the
        user to open the file. The update addresses the vulnerability     by modifying
        how the Microsoft JET Database Engine handles objects     in memory. (CVE-2017-0250)\n\n  -
        An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the Windows     kernel
        fails to properly initialize a memory address, allowing an     attacker to
        retrieve information that could lead to a Kernel Address     Space Layout
        Randomization (KASLR) bypass. (CVE-2017-0299)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege
        vulnerability exists in Windows when the     Win32k component fails to properly
        handle objects in memory. An     attacker who successfully exploited this
        vulnerability could run     arbitrary code in kernel mode. An attacker could
        then install     programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new accounts     with
        full user rights. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker     would first
        have to log on to the system. An attacker could then     run a specially crafted
        application that could exploit the     vulnerability and take control of an
        affected system. The update     addresses this vulnerability by correcting
        how Win32k handles     objects in memory. (CVE-2017-8593)\n\n  - A remote
        code execution vulnerability exists when Windows Search     handles objects
        in memory. An attacker who successfully exploited     this vulnerability could
        take control of the affected system. An     attacker could then install programs;
        view, change, or delete     data; or create new accounts with full user rights.
        To exploit the     vulnerability, the attacker could send specially crafted
        messages     to the Windows Search service. An attacker with access to a target     computer
        could exploit this vulnerability to elevate privileges     and take control
        of the computer. Additionally, in an enterprise     scenario, a remote unauthenticated
        attacker could remotely trigger     the vulnerability through an SMB connection
        and then take control     of a target computer. The security update addresses
        the     vulnerability by correcting how Windows Search handles objects in     memory.
        (CVE-2017-8620)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when
        the Windows     Common Log File System (CLFS) driver improperly handles objects
        in     memory. In a local attack scenario, an attacker could exploit this     vulnerability
        by running a specially crafted application to take     control of the affected
        system. An attacker who successfully     exploited this vulnerability could
        run processes in an elevated     context. The update addresses the vulnerability
        by correcting how     CLFS handles objects in memory. Note: The Common Log
        File System     (CLFS) is a high-performance, general-purpose log file subsystem     that
        dedicated client applications can use and multiple clients     can share to
        optimize log access. (CVE-2017-8624)\n\n  - This security update resolves
        a vulnerability in Windows Error     Reporting (WER). The vulnerability could
        allow elevation of     privilege if successfully exploited by an attacker.
        An attacker     who successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain greater     access
        to sensitive information and system functionality. This     update corrects
        the way the WER handles and executes files.\n    (CVE-2017-8633)\n\n  - A
        remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way that     Microsoft browser
        JavaScript engines render content when     handling objects in memory. The
        vulnerability could corrupt     memory in such a way that an attacker could
        execute arbitrary     code in the context of the current user. (CVE-2017-8636)\n\n  -
        A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     JavaScript engines
        render when handling objects in memory     in Microsoft browsers. The vulnerability
        could corrupt memory     in such a way that an attacker could execute arbitrary
        code in     the context of the current user. An attacker who successfully     exploited
        the vulnerability could gain the same user rights as     the current user.
        If the current user is logged on with     administrative user rights, an attacker
        who successfully exploited     the vulnerability could take control of an
        affected system. An     attacker could then install programs; view, change,
        or delete     data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n    (CVE-2017-8641)\n\n  -
        A remote code execution vulnerability exists when Internet     Explorer improperly
        accesses objects in memory. The vulnerability     could corrupt memory in
        such a way that an attacker could execute     arbitrary code in the context
        of the current user.\n    (CVE-2017-8651)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability
        exists when Microsoft     browsers improperly access objects in memory. The
        vulnerability     could corrupt memory in such a way that enables an attacker
        to     execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.\n    (CVE-2017-8653)\n\n  -
        An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the win32k     component
        improperly provides kernel information. An attacker     who successfully exploited
        the vulnerability could obtain     information to further compromise the user''s
        system.\n    (CVE-2017-8666)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability
        exists when the Volume     Manager Extension Drivercomponent improperly provides
        kernel     information. An attacker who successfully exploited the     vulnerability
        could obtain information to further compromise the     users system. To exploit
        this vulnerability, an attacker would     have to log on to an affected system
        and run a specially crafted     application. The security update addresses
        the vulnerability by     correcting how Volume Manager Extension Driver handles
        objects in     memory. (CVE-2017-8668)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability
        exists when the Windows font     library improperly handles specially crafted
        embedded fonts. An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     would
        gain code execution on the target system. Users whose     accounts are configured
        to have fewer user rights on the system     could be less impacted than users
        who operate with administrative     user rights. There are multiple ways an
        attacker could exploit the     vulnerability: In a web-based attack scenario,
        an attacker could     host a specially crafted website that is designed to
        exploit the     vulnerability and then convince users to view the website.
        An     attacker would have no way to force users to view the     attacker-controlled
        content. Instead, an attacker would have to     convince users to take action,
        typically by getting them to click     a link in an email or Instant Messenger
        message that takes users     to the attacker''s website, or by opening an
        attachment sent     through email. In a file sharing attack scenario, an attacker     could
        provide a specially crafted document file that is designed     to exploit
        the vulnerability, and then convince users to open the     document file.
        The security update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting how the
        Windows font library handles embedded fonts.\n    (CVE-2017-8691)"},{"id":"103122","name":"Security
        Updates for Microsoft Publisher Products (September 2017)","description":"The
        Microsoft Publisher Products are missing a security update. It is, therefore,
        affected by the following vulnerability :\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability
        exists in     Microsoft Office software when it fails to properly     handle
        objects in memory. An attacker who successfully     exploited the vulnerability
        could use a specially     crafted file to perform actions in the security
        context     of the current user. For example, the file could then     take
        actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the     same permissions as the
        current user. Exploitation of     this vulnerability requires that a user
        open a specially     crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft     Office
        software. In an email attack scenario, an     attacker could exploit the vulnerability
        by sending the     specially crafted file to the user and convincing the     user
        to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario,     an attacker could host
        a website (or leverage a     compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided     content)
        that contains a specially crafted file that is     designed to exploit the
        vulnerability. However, an     attacker would have no way to force the user
        to visit     the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince     the
        user to click a link, typically by way of an     enticement in an email or
        Instant Messenger message, and     then convince the user to open the specially

        vulnerability exists in the     way that the Windows Graphics Device Interface
        (GDI)     handles objects in memory, allowing an attacker to     retrieve
        information from a targeted system. By itself,     the information disclosure
        does not allow arbitrary code     execution; however, it could allow arbitrary
        code to be     run if the attacker uses it in combination with another     vulnerability.
        To exploit this vulnerability, an     attacker would have to log on to an
        affected system and     run a specially crafted application. Note that where
        the     severity is indicated as Critical in the Affected     Products table,
        the Preview Pane is an attack vector for     this vulnerability. The security

        objects in memory. An attacker who successfully     exploited the vulnerability
        could use a specially     crafted file to perform actions in the security
        context     of the current user. For example, the file could then     take
        actions on behalf of the logged-on user with the     same permissions as the
        current user. Exploitation of     this vulnerability requires that a user
        open a specially     crafted file with an affected version of Microsoft     Office
        software. In an email attack scenario, an     attacker could exploit the vulnerability
        by sending the     specially crafted file to the user and convincing the     user
        to open the file. In a web-based attack scenario,     an attacker could host
        a website (or leverage a     compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided     content)
        that contains a specially crafted file that is     designed to exploit the
        vulnerability. However, an     attacker would have no way to force the user
        to visit     the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince     the
        user to click a link, typically by way of an     enticement in an email or
        Instant Messenger message, and     then convince the user to open the specially
        crafted     file. The security update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting
        how Microsoft Office handles files in memory.\n    (CVE-2017-8630, CVE-2017-8744)\n\n  -
        A remote code execution vulnerability exists when the     Windows font library
        improperly handles specially     crafted embedded fonts. An attacker who successfully     exploited
        this vulnerability could take control of the     affected system. An attacker
        could then install     programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new     accounts
        with full user rights. Users whose accounts are     configured to have fewer
        user rights on the system could     be less impacted than users who operate
        with     administrative user rights. There are multiple ways an     attacker
        could exploit this vulnerability. In a web-     based attack scenario, an
        attacker could host a     specially crafted website that is designed to exploit     this
        vulnerability and then convince a user to view the     website. An attacker
        would have no way to force users to     view the attacker-controlled content.
        Instead, an     attacker would have to convince users to take action,     typically
        by getting them to click a link in an email     message or in an Instant Messenger
        message that takes     users to the attacker''s website, or by opening an     attachment
        sent through email. In a file sharing attack     scenario, an attacker could
        provide a specially crafted     document file that is designed to exploit
        this     vulnerability, and then convince a user to open the     document
        file. The security update addresses the     vulnerabilities by correcting
        how the Windows font     library handles embedded fonts. (CVE-2017-8682)\n\n  -
        An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     Windows Uniscribe
        improperly discloses the contents of     its memory. An attacker who successfully
        exploited the     vulnerability could obtain information to further     compromise
        the users system. There are multiple ways an     attacker could exploit the
        vulnerability, such as by     convincing a user to open a specially crafted
        document     or by convincing a user to visit an untrusted webpage.\n    The
        update addresses the vulnerability by correcting how     Windows Uniscribe
        handles objects in memory.\n    (CVE-2017-8695)\n\n  - A remote code execution
        vulnerability exists due to the     way Windows Uniscribe handles objects
        in memory. An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could
        take control of the affected system. An attacker     could then install programs;
        view, change, or delete     data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n    Users
        whose accounts are configured to have fewer user     rights on the system
        could be less impacted than users     who operate with administrative user
        rights. There are     multiple ways an attacker could exploit this     vulnerability:
        In a web-based attack scenario, an     attacker could host a specially crafted
        website designed     to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user     to
        view the website. An attacker would have no way to     force users to view
        the attacker-controlled content.\n    Instead, an attacker would have to convince
        users to     take action, typically by getting them to click a link     in
        an email or instant message that takes users to the     attacker''s website,
        or by opening an attachment sent     through email. In a file-sharing attack
        scenario, an     attacker could provide a specially crafted document file     designed
        to exploit this vulnerability and then convince     a user to open the document
        file.The security update     addresses the vulnerability by correcting how
        Windows     Uniscribe handles objects in memory. (CVE-2017-8696)\n\n  - A
        remote code execution vulnerability exists in     Microsoft Office software
        when the software fails to     properly handle objects in memory. An attacker
        who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could run     arbitrary code
        in the context of the current user. If     the current user is logged on with
        administrative user     rights, an attacker could take control of the affected     system.
        An attacker could then install programs; view,     change, or delete data;
        or create new accounts with full     user rights. Users whose accounts are
        configured to have     fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted     than
        users who operate with administrative user rights.\n    Exploitation of the
        vulnerability requires that a user     open a specially crafted file with
        an affected version     of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack     scenario,
        an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by     sending the specially crafted

        it could allow arbitrary code to be     run if the attacker uses it in combination
        with another     vulnerability. To exploit this vulnerability, an     attacker
        would have to log on to an affected system and     run a specially crafted
        application. Note that where the     severity is indicated as Critical in

        view, change, or delete data; or create new     accounts with full user rights.
        Users whose accounts are     configured to have fewer user rights on the system
        could     be less impacted than users who operate with     administrative
        user rights. There are multiple ways an     attacker could exploit this vulnerability.
        In a web-     based attack scenario, an attacker could host a     specially
        crafted website that is designed to exploit     this vulnerability and then
        convince a user to view the     website. An attacker would have no way to
        force users to     view the attacker-controlled content. Instead, an     attacker
        would have to convince users to take action,     typically by getting them
        to click a link in an email     message or in an Instant Messenger message
        that takes     users to the attacker''s website, or by opening an     attachment
        sent through email. In a file sharing attack     scenario, an attacker could
        provide a specially crafted     document file that is designed to exploit
        this     vulnerability, and then convince a user to open the     document

        A remote code execution vulnerability exists when     Windows Shell does not
        properly validate file copy     destinations. An attacker who successfully
        exploited the     vulnerability could run arbitrary code in the context of     the
        current user. If the current user is logged on with     administrative user
        rights, an attacker could take     control of the affected system. An attacker
        could then     install programs; view, change, or delete data; or     create
        new accounts with full user rights. Users whose     accounts are configured
        to have fewer user rights on the     system could be less impacted than users
        who operate     with administrative user rights. To exploit the     vulnerability,
        a user must open a specially crafted     file. In an email attack scenario,
        an attacker could     exploit the vulnerability by sending the specially     crafted
        file to the user and then convincing the user to     open the file. In a web-based
        attack scenario, an     attacker could host a website (or leverage a compromised     website

        the user to open     the specially crafted file. The security update     addresses
        the vulnerability by helping to ensure that     Windows Shell validates file
        copy destinations.\n    (CVE-2017-8699)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability
        exists when the     Windows kernel fails to properly initialize a memory     address,
        allowing an attacker to retrieve information     that could lead to a Kernel
        Address Space Layout     Randomization (KASLR) bypass. An attacker who     successfully
        exploited this vulnerability could retrieve     the base address of the kernel
        driver from a compromised     process. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker     would
        have to log on to an affected system and run a     specially crafted application.
        The security update     addresses the vulnerability by correcting how the     Windows
        kernel handles memory addresses. (CVE-2017-8708)\n\n  - An information disclosure
        vulnerability exists when     Windows Uniscribe improperly discloses the contents
        of     its memory. An attacker who successfully exploited the     vulnerability
        could obtain information to further     compromise the users system. There
        are multiple ways an     attacker could exploit the vulnerability, such as
        by     convincing a user to open a specially crafted document     or by convincing
        a user to visit an untrusted webpage.\n    The update addresses the vulnerability
        by correcting how     Windows Uniscribe handles objects in memory.\n    (CVE-2017-8695)\n\n  -
        An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Windows when the Win32k
        component fails to properly     handle objects in memory. An attacker who
        successfully     exploited this vulnerability could run arbitrary code in     kernel
        mode. An attacker could then install programs;\n    view, change, or delete
        data; or create new accounts     with full user rights. To exploit this vulnerability,
        an     attacker would first have to log on to the system. An     attacker
        could then run a specially crafted application     that could exploit the
        vulnerability and take control of     an affected system. The update addresses
        this     vulnerability by correcting how Win32k handles objects     in memory.
        (CVE-2017-8720)\n\n  - A information disclosure vulnerability exists when
        the     Windows GDI+ component improperly discloses kernel     memory addresses.
        An attacker who successfully exploited     the vulnerability could obtain
        information to further     compromise the users system. To exploit this     vulnerability,
        an attacker would have to log on to an     affected system and run a specially
        crafted application.\n    The vulnerability would not allow an attacker to
        execute     code or to elevate user rights directly, but it could be     used
        to obtain information that could be used to try to     further compromise
        the affected system. The security     update addresses the vulnerability by
        correcting how the     Windows GDI+ component handles objects in memory.\n    (CVE-2017-8680,
        CVE-2017-8681, CVE-2017-8684,     CVE-2017-8685)\n\n  - A remote code execution
        vulnerability exists due to the     way Windows Uniscribe handles objects
        in memory. An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could
        take control of the affected system. An attacker     could then install programs;
        view, change, or delete     data; or create new accounts with full user rights.\n    Users
        whose accounts are configured to have fewer user     rights on the system
        could be less impacted than users     who operate with administrative user
        rights. There are     multiple ways an attacker could exploit this     vulnerability:
        In a web-based attack scenario, an     attacker could host a specially crafted
        website designed     to exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user     to
        view the website. An attacker would have no way to     force users to view
        the attacker-controlled content.\n    Instead, an attacker would have to convince
        users to     take action, typically by getting them to click a link     in
        an email or instant message that takes users to the     attacker''s website,
        or by opening an attachment sent     through email. In a file-sharing attack
        scenario, an     attacker could provide a specially crafted document file     designed
        to exploit this vulnerability and then convince     a user to open the document
        file.The security update     addresses the vulnerability by correcting how
        Windows     Uniscribe handles objects in memory. (CVE-2017-8696)\n\n  - An
        information disclosure vulnerability exists in the     way that the Windows
        Graphics Device Interface+ (GDI+)     handles objects in memory, allowing
        an attacker to     retrieve information from a targeted system. By itself,     the
        information disclosure does not allow arbitrary code     execution; however,
        it could allow arbitrary code to be     run if the attacker uses it in combination
        with another     vulnerability. To exploit this vulnerability, an     attacker
        would have to log on to an affected system and     run a specially crafted
        application. The security update     addresses the vulnerability by correcting
        how GDI+     handles memory addresses. (CVE-2017-8688)\n\n  - An elevation
        of privilege vulnerability exists in     Windows when the Windows kernel-mode
        driver fails to     properly handle objects in memory. An attacker who     successfully
        exploited this vulnerability could run     arbitrary code in kernel mode.
        An attacker could then     install programs; view, change, or delete data;
        or     create new accounts with full user rights. To exploit     this vulnerability,
        an attacker would first have to log     on to the system. An attacker could
        then run a specially     crafted application that could exploit the vulnerability     and
        take control of an affected system. The update     addresses this vulnerability
        by correcting how the     Windows kernel-mode driver handles objects in memory.\n    (CVE-2017-8675)\n\n  -
        A spoofing vulnerability exists in Microsoft''s     implementation of the
        Bluetooth stack. An attacker who     successfully exploited this vulnerability
        could perform     a man-in-the-middle attack and force a user''s computer     to
        unknowingly route traffic through the attacker''s     computer. The attacker
        can then monitor and read the     traffic before sending it on to the intended
        recipient.\n    To exploit the vulnerability, the attacker needs to be     within
        the physical proximity of the targeted user, and     the user''s computer
        needs to have Bluetooth enabled. The     attacker can then initiate a Bluetooth
        connection to the     target computer without the user''s knowledge. The     security
        update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting how Windows handles Bluetooth
        requests.\n    (CVE-2017-8628)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability
        exists when the     Windows kernel improperly handles objects in memory. An     attacker
        who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could obtain information

        an attacker would     have to log on to an affected system and run a specially     crafted
        application. The vulnerability would not allow     an attacker to execute
        code or to elevate user rights     directly, but it could be used to obtain
        information     that could be used to try to further compromise the     affected
        system. The update addresses the vulnerability     by correcting how the Windows
        kernel handles objects in     memory. (CVE-2017-8678, CVE-2017-8679, CVE-2017-8709,     CVE-2017-8719)\n\n  -

        :\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists in     Microsoft Office
        software when it fails to properly     handle objects in memory. An attacker
        who successfully     exploited the vulnerability could use a specially     crafted
        file to perform actions in the security context     of the current user. For
        example, the file could then     take actions on behalf of the logged-on user
        with the     same permissions as the current user. Exploitation of     this
        vulnerability requires that a user open a specially     crafted file with
        an affected version of Microsoft     Office software. In an email attack scenario,
        an     attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending the     specially
        crafted file to the user and convincing the     user to open the file. In
        a web-based attack scenario,     an attacker could host a website (or leverage
        a     compromised website that accepts or hosts user-provided     content)
        that contains a specially crafted file that is     designed to exploit the
        vulnerability. However, an     attacker would have no way to force the user
        to visit     the website. Instead, an attacker would have to convince     the
        user to click a link, typically by way of an     enticement in an email or
        Instant Messenger message, and     then convince the user to open the specially
        crafted     file. The security update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting
        how Microsoft Office handles files in memory.\n    (CVE-2017-8631)\n\n  -
        A remote code execution vulnerability exists in     Microsoft Office software
        when the software fails to     properly handle objects in memory. An attacker
        who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could run     arbitrary code
        in the context of the current user. If     the current user is logged on with
        administrative user     rights, an attacker could take control of the affected     system.
        An attacker could then install programs; view,     change, or delete data;
        or create new accounts with full     user rights. Users whose accounts are
        configured to have     fewer user rights on the system could be less impacted     than
        users who operate with administrative user rights.\n    Exploitation of the
        vulnerability requires that a user     open a specially crafted file with
        an affected version     of Microsoft Office software. In an email attack     scenario,
        an attacker could exploit the vulnerability by     sending the specially crafted
        file to the user and     convincing the user to open the file. In a web-based     attack
        scenario, an attacker could host a website (or     leverage a compromised
        website that accepts or hosts     user-provided content) that contains a specially
        crafted     file designed to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker     would
        have no way to force users to visit the website.\n    Instead, an attacker
        would have to convince users to     click a link, typically by way of an enticement
        in an     email or instant message, and then convince them to open     the
        specially crafted file. Note that the Preview Pane     is not an attack vector
        for this vulnerability. The     security update addresses the vulnerability
        by     correcting how Office handles objects in memory.\n    (CVE-2017-8742,
        CVE-2017-8743)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability exists due to
        the     way Windows Uniscribe handles objects in memory. An     attacker who
        successfully exploited this vulnerability     could take control of the affected
        system. An attacker     could then install programs; view, change, or delete     data;
        or create new accounts with full user rights.\n    Users whose accounts are
        configured to have fewer user     rights on the system could be less impacted
        than users     who operate with administrative user rights. There are     multiple
        ways an attacker could exploit this     vulnerability: In a web-based attack
        scenario, an     attacker could host a specially crafted website designed     to
        exploit this vulnerability and then convince a user     to view the website.
        An attacker would have no way to     force users to view the attacker-controlled
        content.\n    Instead, an attacker would have to convince users to     take
        action, typically by getting them to click a link     in an email or instant
        message that takes users to the     attacker''s website, or by opening an
        attachment sent     through email. In a file-sharing attack scenario, an     attacker
        could provide a specially crafted document file     designed to exploit this
        vulnerability and then convince     a user to open the document file.The security
        update     addresses the vulnerability by correcting how Windows     Uniscribe
        handles objects in memory. (CVE-2017-8696)"},{"id":"103220","name":"KB4038806:

        exists when the     scripting engine does not properly handle objects in     memory
        in Microsoft browsers. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability
        could obtain     information to further compromise the users system.\n    (CVE-2017-11791)\n\n  -
        A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in     Microsoft Edge as a
        result of how memory is accessed in     code compiled by the Edge Just-In-Time
        (JIT) compiler     that allows Control Flow Guard (CFG) to be bypassed. By     itself,
        this CFG bypass vulnerability does not allow     arbitrary code execution.
        However, an attacker could use     the CFG bypass vulnerability in conjunction
        with another     vulnerability, such as a remote code execution     vulnerability,
        to run arbitrary code on a target system.\n    (CVE-2017-11874)\n\n  - A security
        feature bypass exists when Device Guard     incorrectly validates an untrusted
        file. An attacker who     successfully exploited this vulnerability could
        make an     unsigned file appear to be signed. Because Device Guard     relies
        on the signature to determine the file is non-     malicious, Device Guard
        could then allow a malicious     file to execute. In an attack scenario, an
        attacker     could make an untrusted file appear to be a trusted     file.
        The update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting how Device Guard
        handles untrusted files.\n    (CVE-2017-11830)\n\n  - An information disclosure
        vulnerability exists when     Internet Explorer improperly handles page content,

        which     depends on CredSSP for authentication may be vulnerable     to this
        type of attack. As an example of how an attacker     would exploit this vulnerability
        against Remote Desktop     Protocol, the attacker would need to run a specially     crafted
        application and perform a man-in-the-middle     attack against a Remote Desktop

        on with     administrative user rights, an attacker could take     control
        of the affected system. An attacker could then     install programs; view,
        change, or delete data; or     create new accounts with full user rights.
        Users whose     accounts are configured to have fewer user rights on the     system

        the vulnerability could cause the host server     to crash.  (CVE-2018-0885)\n\n  -
        A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the     Credential Security
        Support Provider protocol (CredSSP).\n    An attacker who successfully exploited
        this     vulnerability could relay user credentials and use them     to execute
        code on the target system. CredSSP is an     authentication provider which
        processes authentication     requests for other applications; any application
        which     depends on CredSSP for authentication may be vulnerable     to this
        type of attack. As an example of how an attacker     would exploit this vulnerability
        against Remote Desktop     Protocol, the attacker would need to run a specially     crafted
        application and perform a man-in-the-middle     attack against a Remote Desktop
        Protocol session. An     attacker could then install programs; view, change,
        or     delete data; or create new accounts with full user     rights. The
        security update addresses the vulnerability     by correcting how Credential
        Security Support Provider     protocol (CredSSP) validates requests during
        the     authentication process. To be fully protected against     this vulnerability
        users must enable Group Policy     settings on their systems and update their
        Remote     Desktop clients. The Group Policy settings are disabled     by
        default to prevent connectivity problems and users     must follow the instructions
        documented HERE to be fully     protected. (CVE-2018-0886)\n\n  - An information

        A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way that     the Windows Code
        Integrity Module performs hashing. An     attacker who successfully exploited
        the vulnerability     could cause a system to stop responding. Note that the     denial
        of service condition would not allow an attacker     to execute code or to
        elevate user privileges. However,     the denial of service condition could
        prevent authorized     users from using system resources. An attacker could     host
        a specially crafted file in a website or SMB share.\n    The attacker could
        also take advantage of compromised     websites, or websites that accept or
        host user-provided     content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted     content
        that could exploit the vulnerability. However,     in all cases an attacker
        would have no way to force     users to view the attacker-controlled content.
        Instead,     an attacker would have to convince users to take action,     typically
        via an enticement in email or instant message,     or by getting them to open
        an email attachment. The     security update addresses the vulnerability by
        modifying     how the Code Integrity Module performs hashing.\n    (CVE-2018-1040)\n\n  -

        An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when     Windows Hyper-V instruction
        emulation fails to properly     enforce privilege levels. An attacker who
        successfully     exploited this vulnerability could gain elevated     privileges
        on a target guest operating system. The host     operating system is not vulnerable
        to this attack. This     vulnerability by itself does not allow arbitrary
        code to     be run. However, the vulnerability could be used in     conjunction
        with one or more vulnerabilities (e.g. a     remote code execution vulnerability
        and another     elevation of privilege) that could take advantage of the     elevated
        privileges when running. The update addresses     the vulnerability by correcting
        how privileges are     enforced by Windows Hyper-V instruction emulation.\n    (CVE-2018-8219)\n\n  -
        A remote code execution vulnerability exists when     Microsoft Edge improperly
        accesses objects in memory.\n    The vulnerability could corrupt memory in

        An information disclosure vulnerability exists when Edge     improperly marks
        files. An attacker who successfully     exploited this vulnerability could
        exfiltrate file     contents from disk. For an attack to be successful, an     attacker
        must persuade a user to open a malicious     website. The security update
        addresses the vulnerability     by properly marking files. (CVE-2018-0871)\n\n  -
        A denial of service vulnerability exists in the way that     the Windows Code
        Integrity Module performs hashing. An     attacker who successfully exploited
        the vulnerability     could cause a system to stop responding. Note that the     denial
        of service condition would not allow an attacker     to execute code or to
        elevate user privileges. However,     the denial of service condition could
        prevent authorized     users from using system resources. An attacker could     host
        a specially crafted file in a website or SMB share.\n    The attacker could
        also take advantage of compromised     websites, or websites that accept or
        host user-provided     content or advertisements, by adding specially crafted     content
        that could exploit the vulnerability. However,     in all cases an attacker
        would have no way to force     users to view the attacker-controlled content.
        Instead,     an attacker would have to convince users to take action,     typically
        via an enticement in email or instant message,     or by getting them to open
        an email attachment. The     security update addresses the vulnerability by
        modifying     how the Code Integrity Module performs hashing.\n    (CVE-2018-1040)\n\n  -
        A security feature bypass vulnerability exists in     Internet Explorer that
        allows for bypassing Mark of the     Web Tagging (MOTW). Failing to set the

        cross-site scripting attacks on affected systems     and run script in the
        security context of the current     user. These attacks could allow the attacker
        to read     content that the attacker is not authorized to read, use     the
        victim''s identity to take actions on the SharePoint     site on behalf of
        the user, such as change permissions     and delete content, and inject malicious
        content in the     browser of the user. The security update addresses the     vulnerability

        4343887.\nIt is, therefore, affected by multiple vulnerabilities :\n\n  -
        An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the     Windows kernel
        improperly handles objects in memory. An     attacker who successfully exploited
        this vulnerability     could obtain information to further compromise the
        users     system.  (CVE-2018-8341, CVE-2018-8348)\n\n  - A remote code execution
        vulnerability exists when the     Windows font library improperly handles
        specially     crafted embedded fonts. An attacker who successfully     exploited
        the vulnerability could take control of the     affected system. An attacker
        could then install     programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new     accounts
        with full user rights.  (CVE-2018-8344)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability
        exists in the     Network Driver Interface Specification (NDIS) when     ndis.sys
        fails to check the length of a buffer prior to     copying memory to it.  (CVE-2018-8343)\n\n  -
        A remote code execution vulnerability exists in     &quot;Microsoft COM for
        Windows&quot; when it fails to     properly handle serialized objects. An
        attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could use a     specially
        crafted file or script to perform actions. In     an email attack scenario,
        an attacker could exploit the     vulnerability by sending the specially crafted
        file to     the user and convincing the user to open the file.\n    (CVE-2018-8349)\n\n  -
        A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when     Microsoft Edge improperly
        handles redirect requests. The     vulnerability allows Microsoft Edge to
        bypass Cross-     Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) redirect restrictions,     and
        to follow redirect requests that should otherwise be     ignored. An attacker
        who successfully exploited the     vulnerability could force the browser to
        send data that     would otherwise be restricted to a destination website     of
        the attacker''s choice.  (CVE-2018-8358)\n\n  - A security feature bypass
        vulnerability exists in Device     Guard that could allow an attacker to inject
        malicious     code into a Windows PowerShell session. An attacker who     successfully
        exploited this vulnerability could inject     code into a trusted PowerShell
        process to bypass the     Device Guard Code Integrity policy on the local
        machine.\n    (CVE-2018-8200, CVE-2018-8204)\n\n  - A remote code execution
        vulnerability exists in the way     the scripting engine handles objects in
        memory in     Microsoft browsers. The vulnerability could corrupt     memory
        in such a way that an attacker could execute     arbitrary code in the context
        of the current user. An     attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability     could
        gain the same user rights as the current user.\n    (CVE-2018-8355, CVE-2018-8372,
        CVE-2018-8385)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Microsoft
        Windows when the Windows kernel fails to     properly handle parsing of certain
        symbolic links. An     attacker who successfully exploited this vulnerability     could
        potentially access privileged registry keys and     thereby elevate permissions.
        An attacker could then     install programs; view, change, or delete data;
        or     create new accounts with full user rights.\n    (CVE-2018-8347)\n\n  -
        A remote code execution vulnerability exists in     Microsoft Windows that
        could allow remote code execution     if a .LNK file is processed. An attacker
        who     successfully exploited this vulnerability could gain the     same
        user rights as the local user.  (CVE-2018-8345)\n\n  - A information disclosure
        vulnerability exists when     WebAudio Library improperly handles audio requests.
        An     attacker who has successfully exploited this     vulnerability might
        be able to read privileged data     across trust boundaries. In browsing scenarios,
        an     attacker could convince a user to visit a malicious site     and leverage
        the vulnerability to obtain privileged     information from the browser process,
        such as sensitive     data from other opened tabs. An attacker could also     inject
        malicious code into advertising networks used by     trusted sites or embed
        malicious code on a compromised,     but trusted, site. The update addresses
        the     vulnerability by correcting how the WebAudio Library     handles audio
        requests. (CVE-2018-8370)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists
        in     Windows when the Win32k component fails to properly     handle objects
        in memory. An attacker who successfully     exploited this vulnerability could
        run arbitrary code in     kernel mode. An attacker could then install programs;\n    view,
        change, or delete data; or create new accounts     with full user rights.  (CVE-2018-8404)\n\n  -
        An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in the     Windows Installer
        when the Windows Installer fails to     properly sanitize input leading to
        an insecure library     loading behavior. A locally authenticated attacker
        could     run arbitrary code with elevated system privileges. An     attacker
        could then install programs; view, change, or     delete data; or create new
        accounts with full user     rights. The security update addresses the vulnerability     by
        correcting the input sanitization error to preclude     unintended elevation.
        (CVE-2018-8339)\n\n  - A security feature bypass vulnerability exists when     Active
        Directory Federation Services (AD FS) improperly     handles multi-factor
        authentication requests.\n    (CVE-2018-8340)\n\n  - A remote code execution
        vulnerability exists in the way     that the Chakra scripting engine handles
        objects in     memory in Microsoft Edge. The vulnerability could     corrupt
        memory in such a way that an attacker could     execute arbitrary code in
        the context of the current     user. An attacker who successfully exploited
        the     vulnerability could gain the same user rights as the     current user.  (CVE-2018-8266,
        CVE-2018-8381)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists when     Microsoft
        Cortana allows arbitrary website browsing on     the lockscreen. An attacker
        who successfully exploited     the vulnerability could steal browser stored
        passwords     or log on to websites as another user.  (CVE-2018-8253)\n\n  -
        A remote code execution vulnerability exists when     Internet Explorer improperly
        validates hyperlinks before     loading executable libraries. An attacker
        who     successfully exploited this vulnerability could take     control of
        an affected system. An attacker could then     install programs; view, change,
        or delete data; or     create new accounts with full user rights.\n    (CVE-2018-8316)\n\n  -
        An information disclosure vulnerability exists when the     Windows GDI component
        improperly discloses the contents     of its memory. An attacker who successfully
        exploited     the vulnerability could obtain information to further     compromise
        the users system. There are multiple ways an     attacker could exploit the
        vulnerability, such as by     convincing a user to open a specially crafted
        document,     or by convincing a user to visit an untrusted webpage.\n    The
        security update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting how the Windows
        GDI component handles objects     in memory. (CVE-2018-8394, CVE-2018-8398)\n\n  -
        A remote code execution vulnerability exists in the way     that Microsoft
        browsers access objects in memory. The     vulnerability could corrupt memory
        in a way that could     allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code in the     context
        of the current user. An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability
        could gain the     same user rights as the current user.  (CVE-2018-8403)\n\n  -
        An information disclosure vulnerability exists when     affected Microsoft
        browsers improperly allow cross-frame     interaction. An attacker who successfully
        exploited this     vulnerability could allow an attacker to obtain browser     frame
        or window state from a different domain. For an     attack to be successful,
        an attacker must persuade a     user to open a malicious website from a secure
        website.\n    This update addresses the vulnerability by denying     permission
        to read the state of the object model, to     which frames or windows on different
        domains should not     have access. (CVE-2018-8351)\n\n  - An elevation of
        privilege vulnerability exists in     Microsoft browsers allowing sandbox
        escape. An attacker     who successfully exploited the vulnerability could
        use     the sandbox escape to elevate privileges on an affected     system.
        This vulnerability by itself does not allow     arbitrary code execution;
        however, it could allow     arbitrary code to be run if the attacker uses
        it in     combination with another vulnerability (such as a remote     code
        execution vulnerability or another elevation of     privilege vulnerability)
        that is capable of leveraging     the elevated privileges when code execution
        is     attempted. (CVE-2018-8357)\n\n  - An Elevation of Privilege vulnerability
        exists when     Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector allows file creation     in
        arbitrary locations.  (CVE-2018-0952)\n\n  - A remote code execution vulnerability
        exists in the way     that the scripting engine handles objects in memory
        in     Internet Explorer. The vulnerability could corrupt     memory in such
        a way that an attacker could execute     arbitrary code in the context of
        the current user. An     attacker who successfully exploited the vulnerability     could
        gain the same user rights as the current user.\n    (CVE-2018-8353, CVE-2018-8371,
        CVE-2018-8373,     CVE-2018-8389)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability
        exists when the     DirectX Graphics Kernel (DXGKRNL) driver improperly     handles
        objects in memory. An attacker who successfully     exploited this vulnerability
        could run processes in an     elevated context.  (CVE-2018-8401, CVE-2018-8405,     CVE-2018-8406)\n\n  -
        An information disclosure vulnerability exists in     Microsoft .NET Framework
        that could allow an attacker to     access information in multi-tenant environments.
        The     vulnerability is caused when .NET Framework is used in     high-load\/high-density
        network connections where content     from one stream can blend into another
        stream.\n    (CVE-2018-8360)\n\n  - A spoofing vulnerability exists when Microsoft
        Edge     improperly handles specific HTML content. An attacker     who successfully
        exploited this vulnerability could     trick a user into believing that the
        user was on a     legitimate website. The specially crafted website could     either
        spoof content or serve as a pivot to chain an     attack with other vulnerabilities
        in web services.\n    (CVE-2018-8388)"},{"id":"111686","name":"KB4343892:

        file. An attacker who     successfully exploited this vulnerability could
        make an     unsigned file appear to be signed. Because Device Guard     relies
        on the signature to determine the file is non-     malicious, Device Guard
        could then allow a malicious     file to execute. In an attack scenario, an
        attacker     could make an untrusted file appear to be a trusted     file.
        The update addresses the vulnerability by     correcting how Device Guard
        handles untrusted files.\n    (CVE-2018-8449)\n\n  - A security feature bypass

        escape to elevate privileges on an affected     system. This vulnerability
        by itself does not allow     arbitrary code execution. However, the vulnerability     could
        allow arbitrary code to run if an attacker uses it     in combination with
        another vulnerability, such as a     remote code execution vulnerability or
        another elevation     of privilege vulnerability, that can leverage the     elevated
        privileges when code execution is attempted.\n    The security update addresses
        the vulnerability by     correcting how Windows parses files. (CVE-2018-8468)\n\n  -

        visit an untrusted webpage.\n    The security update addresses the vulnerability
        by     correcting how the Windows GDI component handles objects     in memory.
        (CVE-2018-8424)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege vulnerability exists in     Windows
        that allows a sandbox escape. An attacker who     successfully exploited the
        vulnerability could use the     sandbox escape to elevate privileges on an
        affected     system. This vulnerability by itself does not allow     arbitrary
        code execution. However, the vulnerability     could allow arbitrary code
        to run if an attacker uses it     in combination with another vulnerability,
        such as a     remote code execution vulnerability or another elevation     of
        privilege vulnerability, that can leverage the     elevated privileges when
        code execution is attempted.\n    The security update addresses the vulnerability

        gain elevated privileges and break out of the Edge     AppContainer sandbox.
        The vulnerability by itself does     not allow arbitrary code to run. However,
        this     vulnerability could be used in conjunction with one or     more vulnerabilities
        (for example a remote code     execution vulnerability and another elevation
        of     privilege vulnerability) to take advantage of the     elevated privileges

        could then install     programs; view, change, or delete data; or create new     accounts
        with full user rights.  (CVE-2018-8332)\n\n  - An information disclosure vulnerability
        exists when the     browser scripting engine improperly handle object types.\n    An
        attacker who has successfully exploited this     vulnerability might be able
        to read privileged data     across trust boundaries. In browsing scenarios,
        an     attacker could convince a user to visit a malicious site     and leverage
        the vulnerability to obtain privileged     information from the browser process,
        such as sensitive     data from other opened tabs. An attacker could also     inject
        malicious code into advertising networks used by     trusted sites or embed
        malicious code on a compromised,     but trusted, site. The security update
        addresses the     vulnerability by correcting how the browser scripting     engine

        affected system to crash. To attempt to exploit this     issue, an attacker
        would need to send specially crafted     SMB requests to the target system.
        Note that the denial     of service vulnerability would not allow an attacker
        to     execute code or to elevate their user rights, but it     could cause
        the affected system to stop accepting     requests. The security update addresses
        the     vulnerability by correcting the manner in which SMB     handles specially
        crafted client requests.\n    (CVE-2018-8335)\n\n  - An elevation of privilege

        Access Connectivity Engine improperly     handles objects in memory. An attacker
        who successfully     exploited this vulnerability could execute arbitrary     code
        on a victim system. An attacker could exploit this     vulnerability by enticing
        a victim to open a specially     crafted file. The update addresses the vulnerability
        by     correcting the way the Microsoft Office Access     Connectivity Engine
        handles objects in memory.\n    (CVE-2019-0823, CVE-2019-0824, CVE-2019-0825,     CVE-2019-0826,

        Excel software when the software fails to     properly handle objects in memory.
        An attacker who     successfully exploited the vulnerability could run     arbitrary
        code in the context of the current user. If     the current user is logged
        on with administrative user     rights, an attacker could take control of
        the affected     system. An attacker could then install programs; view,     change,
        or delete data; or create new accounts with full     user rights.  (CVE-2019-0828)"},{"id":"123953","name":"Security
